#With the previous command, authorize only IP addresses from 10.0.0.0/8 to connect to your system

# iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j ACCEPT
# but before that, one needs to change the INPUT Chain policy to DROP
# because we want to authorize only IP addresses from 10.0.0.0/8
# this is done with "iptables --policy INPUT DROP"
